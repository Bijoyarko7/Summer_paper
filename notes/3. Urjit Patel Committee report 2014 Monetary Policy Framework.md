1. Perils of high inflation and inflation expectations:
The consequences can be far reaching. 
First, with high and persistent inflation, real interest rates
have remained negative for savers during most of the
post-global crisis period leading to a decline in
domestic financial saving. 
Second, since India’s inflation has persisted at a level higher than that of
trading partners, external competitiveness is getting
eroded. If the nominal exchange rate adjusts to offset
the inflation differential it can set off a depreciation-
inflation spiral, thereby undermining macroeconomic stability. 
Third, as the recent experience
demonstrated, the large demand for gold as a hedge
against inflation exacerbated the decline in financial
savings and contributed to a widening of the current
account deficit (CAD), rendering the economy
vulnerable to external shocks. 
Fourth, the consequent weakening of the exchange rate has imposed balance sheet risks on borrowers in foreign currency with the
potential for financial instability. 
Fifth, persistently high inflation adversely impacts the economy’s
allocative efficiency and impedes growth. 
Sixth, high and persistent inflation contributes to a worsening
of income distribution as the poor use
disproportionately higher cash-in-hand as part of their
savings.

2. IT disadvantages:
IT has disadvantages in that (a) some part of
infl ation, such as from food and fuel, is not easily
controlled by monetary policy; (b) it is inherently a
medium-term framework because of the long and
variable lags in monetary policy transmission. The
lack of immediate demonstrability of outcomes can
result in ambiguous perceptions of the policy stance.
Yet another concern has been the instability imparted
to output and employment due to the overarching
emphasis on achieving the infl ation target, and the
observed increase in output losses associated with
disinfl ation.

3. US stance as a inflation targetter: 
Finally, some monetary policy frameworks do
not operate under an explicit nominal anchor, but
such an anchor is implicit and the track record has
been creditable6 (e.g., the US), with forward-looking
behaviour triggering pre-emptive strikes against target
warnings (Appendix Table II.2B). The main criticisms
are the uncertainty in fi nancial markets on policy
actions and herding of expectations; strong
dependence on individual skills and charisma of the
monetary policy wielder; and susceptibility to outside
pressures.

4. Non monetary instruments: 
While the use of monetary instruments in
striving to achieve monetary policy objectives is quite
pervasive, central banks have been employing non-
monetary instruments as part of their overall policy
toolkit and these instruments subserve monetary 
policy considerations eventually. These instruments
are tailored to deal with various exigencies: surges in
capital fl ows; credit allocation; pro-cyclicality and
interconnectedness; and the zero lower bound on the
nominal interest rate, to note a few.
One set of instruments is primarily
regulatory in nature: selective credit control
measures ranging from improving credit culture
(establishing credit bureaus; credit registry; higher
risk weights for sensitive sectors), supervisory
measures (on-site and off-site inspection of banks)
and moral suasion. More recently, in order to halt
the downward spiral of lending and borrowing that
has plagued economies since the recession, central
banks have activated schemes to kick-start the real
economy, best exemplified by the Funding for
Lending Scheme (FLS) initiated in the UK in July
2012 to allow commercial banks to borrow funds at
a cheap rate from the central bank and lend to
specifi ed households and firms. A second set of measures, primarily fi nancial
in nature, work their way through the foreign
exchange market: liberalising/restricting capital fl ows;
intervention in the foreign exchange market and
sterilisation operations; reserve requirements on
foreign currency instruments and variants of the
Tobin tax. A third set of measures is macroprudential in
nature, designed to contain systemic risks. More
specifically, such measures seek to address two
specific dimensions of systemic risk – the time dimension (excessive leverage in upturns and
excessive risk aversion in downturns) and the cross-
sectional dimension or risk concentration (size,
substitutability, interconnectedness) as collapse of
large or systemically important fi nancial institutions
can destabilise the rest of the financial system (Table III.1).

5. Addressing Impediments to Transmission of Monetary Policy


# Ideas
1. Is inflation anchored in India post Inflation targeting? if not then why?
2. Varied nominal anchors around the world. take note, a comparative analysis possible?
# actionables
1. scrap professional forcasters inflation expectations and inflation data (World Econ Outlook, imf, RBI)
2. create something like chart II.1, III.1 and Table II.1
3. Download the papers below and save in specific subject
4. Download The Report of the High Powered Expert Committee on Making Mumbai an International Financial Centre, 2007 (Chairman: Percy S. Mistry), The Report of the Committee on Financial Sector Reforms, 2009 (Chairman: Raghuram G. Rajan), The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission (FSLRC), 2013 (Chairman: B.N. Srikrishna)

Inflation Targetting:
The varied country experience with infl ation targeting (IT) suggests that it has yielded signifi cant benefi ts in terms of reduced infl ation volatility (Svensson, 1997), reduced impact of shocks (Mishkin, 2004) and anchoring of inflation expectations (Kohn 2007,Swanson, 2006, Levin et al., 2004)
